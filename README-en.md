※ There are very few Japanese documents about Drive-by Download Attack and Exploit Kit, and there is a shortage of information. I wrote [this document](https://github.com/nao-sec/RigEK/blob/master/README.md) to make up for it even a little. Because I translated Japanese documents in English, there may be sentences you do not understand when you read.

## What is the Rig Exploit Kit?
The Rig Exploit Kit (RigEK), is one of the Exploit Kit, which is the most currently available in Drive-by Download attack (DbD). DbD is an attack, that do some redirection (drive) to the malicious website prepared by the attacker or A general Web site where malicious code was injected by an attacker (Compromised site) , and finally malware download and install. An attacker's server sends exploit code that exploits vulnerabilities in browsers and other plugins. Those codes  drop and infect malware. Exploit Kit facilitates the flow of this attack. By using Exploit Kit, attackers can easily execute DbD without having expert knowledge and skills. RigEK suddenly from around September 2016 To increase the market share, and now has been used in many of DbD Campaign.

## Using RigEK Campaign
Campaign using RigEK or used in the past is as follows.

- pseudo-Darkleech
- EITest
- GoodMan
- Decimal IP
- Seamless

Among these, pseudo-Darkleech, EITest and GoodMan are no longer observable, and currently Active is Decimal IP and Seamless, each of which is briefly introduced below.

### pseudo-Darkleech
Regarding pseudo-Darkleech, Mr. Brad of Unit 42 has written a very wonderful document, so if you want to know more see it.

[Campaign Evolution: pseudo-Darkleech in 2016](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/12/unit42-campaign-evolution-pseudo-darkleech-2016/)

pseudo-Darkleech injects the following code to the Compromised site and leads it to RigEK.

<img src='http://i.imgur.com/XZ0oTwq.jpg' width='60%'>

Very large scale attack Campaign, a huge number of Web sites suffered damage, but since around April 3, 2017 we could not observe anything.

The features are as follows.

- There is an iframe to guide injected code to RigEK during span, and the top value of span is a large negative value
- The location where the malicious code is injected is either before the html tag or just before the body tag
- Since the noscript tag exists at the end of the injected code, the content of the compromised site does not display properly
- Compromised sites often use older versions of CMS
- When accessing with the same IP, HTTP Status Code 500 is returned
- Accessing many Compromised sites with the same IP returns normal pages that have not been tampered with

As for the cloaking of pseudo-Darkleech, since I am separately writing the document, please refer to that.

[pseudo-Darkleech_cloaking.md](https://github.com/koike/public/blob/master/2017/pseudo-Darkleech_cloaking.md)

### EITest
Regarding EITest, Mr. Brad wrote a wonderful article, so please refer to that.

[Campaign Evolution: EITest from October through December 2016](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/01/unit42-campaign-evolution-eitest-october-december-2016/)

EITest injects the following code to the Compromised site and leads it to RigEK.

<img src='http://i.imgur.com/kV6nyYZ.jpg' width='60%'>

EITest was Campaign, which was active at the same time as pseudo-Darkleech, most of what I could not observe from Japan, but as with pseudo-Darkleech many web sites suffered damage, but EITest Has not been observed since April 28th.

The features are as follows.

- The injected code is a JavaScript code that dynamically generates an iframe, which is directed to RigEK by the iframe
- The malicious code is injected near the close tag of the body tag
- Based on the Geo information of the user, the target to be attacked is limited
- When accessing using the same IP continuously, normal pages are returned

### GoodMan
GoodMan is Campaign which was observed from March 2017. The server was suspended at the beginning of May.I was observing GoodMan from a very early stage and it was noticed from the code mistake that occurred earlier I knew exactly what code was injected.In respect to GoodMan malware breakdown is the most detailed and I recommend you to refer to his article.

[Finding A ‘Good Man’](https://malwarebreakdown.com/2017/03/10/finding-a-good-man/)

<img src='http://i.imgur.com/9O1Vh2o.jpg' width='60%'>

GoodMan does not have so many Compromised sites, so I do not have much information, but I briefly list the features.

- A code in which an iframe exists is injected into the Compromised site in a div tag with top and left values of -500 px
- Because the code of the compromised site is overwritten with the injected code, the contents are not displayed properly
- Not always connected to RigEK

### Decimal IP
Details of Decimal IP were released by Malwarebytes at the end of March 2017. For details, please refer to the article of Malwarebytes.

[Websites compromised in ‘Decimal IP’ campaign](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2017/03/websites-compromised-decimal-ip-campaign/)

Unlike the pseudo-Darkleech and EITest which we introduced so far, we redirect with the HTTP Status Code without redirecting with iframe.Although the principle of operation is a traditional DbD method, it is characterized by using Decimal IP. Commonly used IPv4 expresses four combinations of decimal numbers, but there are other notation methods. It is using this Campaign that it is probably not to be detected by a filter etc. perhaps It seems to be the purpose.

<img src='http://i.imgur.com/TcLxSzK.jpg' width='60%'>

<img src='http://i.imgur.com/h7Wplmv.jpg' width='60%'>

The features are as follows.

- It is not necessarily redirected
- Reach the same gate from multiple Compromised sites
- Process branches when accessing with IE and accessing with Chrome
- You can not access multiple Compromised sites more than once with the same IP

When accessing with IE, it does the above operation, but when accessing with Chrome, it tries to let the user execute malware by using a site imitating the update of Adobe Flash Player without leading to RigEK For details about them, please see the separate article because you have written a separate article.

[Overlooking Decimal IP Campaign](http://www.nao-sec.org/2017/05/overlooking-decimal-ip-campaign.html)

Campaign where logic is primitive and the part with considerably rough cut is conspicuous, it seems that the number of compromised sites is not so much.

### Seamless
I think that Seamless had been observed since around February 2017. A detailed article came out at the end of March. The article of Cisco Umbrella will be very helpful.I have never observed Seamless For details, please refer to that article.

[‘Seamless’ Campaign Delivers Ramnit via Rig EK](https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2017/03/29/seamless-campaign-delivers-ramnit-via-rig-ek/)

## Behavior of RigEK
So far we will see that RigEK is being used by various DbD Campaign. The following figure shows how RigEK moves to the user who redirected from Compromised site to RigEK I will explain.

<img src='http://i.imgur.com/5UmaYpp.jpg' width='60%'>

1. The user accesses the Compromised site
2. Generate a URL that leads to RigEK by injected code into the Compromised site
3. The Compromised site will return data to the user containing the URL that leads to RigEK
4. The user accesses the URL that leads to RIgEK according to the received data RigEK gives the user the obfuscated data including the payload (which exploits vulnerabilities of browsers and plugins) according to the environment of the accessing user return
5. The user downloads and executes the malware with the payload

This trend will allow users to infect malware just by accessing the website.

The traffic in concrete Decimal IP is shown below.The actual pcap file is in [here](decimalip_rig.pcap), so please see the person who wants to see details.

<img src='http://i.imgur.com/oDgtebf.jpg' width='60%'>

The user first accesses the Compromised site, and redirects to the location from the Compromised site by HTTP Status Code 302.

<img src='http://i.imgur.com/ShVHaiE.jpg' width='60%'>

Redirect to the file rig.php by HTTP Status Code 302 in the redirect destination as well.

<img src='http://i.imgur.com/2P1VnIl.jpg' width='60%'>

In rig.php, connect to the URL leading to RigEK.

<img src='http://i.imgur.com/B4kdDrV.jpg' width='60%'>
<img src='http://i.imgur.com/CfuQecJ.jpg' width='60%'>

The browser will then load html containing obfuscated JavaScript and run code that exploits some vulnerability will cause malware to be downloaded and executed.

## RigEK file
In the explanation above, I think that I could understand the approximate movement of RigEK There is no particularly difficult part to be redirected to RigEK, but what does the obfuscated code sent from RigEK do It shows concretely whether it is.

In the following, I refer to the code of [Analyzing Rig Exploit Kit vol.1](http://www.nao-sec.org/2017/04/analyzing-rig-exploit-kit-vol1.html) which I wrote earlier There may be some parts different from the code of the current RigEK, but please change part as appropriate.

When it is induced from an iframe such as Compromised site to RigEK, html like the following will be returned first.

```html

	<meta charset="UTF-8">

Code to read VBScript, JavaScript, wf These codes are code that exploit vulnerabilities such as browsers, which cause malware to be downloaded and executed.

## Relationship between User-Agent and payload
Below is a correspondence table created based on the payload acquired when I accessed RigEK using IE 6 - 11 on May 11, 2017.

![13.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/JHrNrNJ.jpg)

The PDF version is in [here](rig_ua.pdf).

(I have no knowledge of swf, so I have not investigated the vulnerabilities used in swf, but I have marked as to whether swf loads the code to read)

You can see that RigEK uses the User - Agent in the request sent from the user and sends a payload that can be pwned in the user 's environment.

## Introduction of payload
### CVE-2016-0189
>The Microsoft (1) JScript 5.8 and (2) VBScript 5.7 and 5.8 engines, as used in Internet Explorer 9 through 11 and other products, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted web site, aka "Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability," a different vulnerability than CVE-2016-0187. 

http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0189

#### exploit (POC)
1. Create a dummy VBScriptClass instance
2. Obtain the address of the class instance
3. Leak CSession address from class instance
4. Leak COleScript address from CSession instance
5. Overwrite COleScript's SafetyOption


```vb
Function exploit (arg1)
            Dim addr
            Dim csession
            Dim olescript
            Dim mem
            ' Create a vbscript class instance
            Set dm = New Dummy
            ' Get address of the class instance
            addr = getAddr(arg1, dm)
            ' Leak CSession address from class instance
            mem = leakMem(arg1, addr + 8)
            csession = strToInt(Mid(mem, 3, 2))
            ' Leak COleScript address from CSession instance
            mem = leakMem(arg1, csession + 4)
            olescript = strToInt(Mid(mem, 1, 2))
            ' Overwrite SafetyOption in COleScript (e.g. god mode)
            ' e.g. changes it to 0x04 which is not in 0x0B mask
            overwrite arg1, olescript + &H174
```

#### How to use in RIG
There were two version of exploit observed by RIG. Code published in POC and code of VBS part are almost equal, and some obfuscation processing can be seen.

>Nebula EK uses a technique published on BlackHat 2014 [2] to circumvent this problem. When you create a Shell.Application object, IE loads% systemroot% \ system32 \ shell32.dll. Normally% systemroot% is c: \ windows directory. However, an attacker can perform DLL hijacking attacks as follows.
>
>    1) Create the system32 directory in the% temp% \ directory
>    2) in the above created directory to generate a fake shell32.dll file used to load the need to load the program. Nebula EK in the VBScript script will generate a 3K or so files.
>    3) Before creating the Shell.Application object in the script, use WScript.Shell to modify the% system32% environment variable, point to 1) to create the directory
>    4) create a Shell.Application object, which automatically load the fake shell32.dll file to achieve the purpose of the implementation of the document.

### CVE-2015-2419
>JScript 9 in Microsoft Internet Explorer 10 and 11 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted web site, aka "JScript9 Memory Corruption Vulnerability." 

https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2419

#### exploit(POC)
>### CVE-2015-2419 Vulnerability Details
>
>CVE-2015-2419 is a double free vulnerability in jscript9’s native JSON APIs that was patched in July with MS15-065. Specifically, the vulnerability exists in the way that JSON.stringify parses deeply nested JSON data as follows. The attacker’s chosen arguments to JSON.stringify are reproduced in their entirety in the appendix.

https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2015/08/cve-2015-2419_inte.html

```js
Il1I4['prototype'].yc =
    function(a) {
        if (!a.ma(!1)) throw new Error(3);
        a.kb(!1);
        a.ib(!1);
        JSON["stringify"](this.Pc, this.uc);
        a.ob(!1);
        CollectGarbage()
    };
```

#### How to use in RIG
Overall it is hard to read, it was slightly obfuscated from js written in FireEye's article.

>xexec() is a custom function which uses a key on the exploit kit landing page to decrypt the path from where the payload has to be fetched.

>The payload fetched from above path is encrypted. It will be decrypted using XTEA algorithm by the shellcode. The XTEA key used is present in the deobfuscated HTML page. In our case, it is: Du9JOBgkbfzGvmFF.

```
this.scope.Xc = xexec

...(snip)

function Il1I$() {
        Il1Id(this, Il1I_());
        this.Za = new Il1I9(""[this.scope.Xc](), "Du9JOBgkbfzGvmFF");
```

## Finally
This is the form of RigEK that I have observed so far. If the advanced Drive-by Download Attack and Exploit Kit evolved highly, I am worried that it will cause many damage in the future. RigEK will be more advanced in the futur. I would be pleased if you read this article, you will be able to know even a little "How is the Drive-by Download Attack actually done?" "What is the Exploit Kit?"
